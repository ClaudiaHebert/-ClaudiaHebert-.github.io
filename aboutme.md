subtitle: Why I'm totally capable and competent at coding and Github

My name is Claudia. I have the following qualities:

- I am quite anxious but in a way that makes it impossible to procrastinate and makes me pretty productive 
- I am constantly trying random new activities and hobbies

What else do you need?

### My story

To be honest, I'm still trying to understand this whole Github thing so this is all I can give you right now, I need to go set up other parts of the site.
